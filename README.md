# matPkg

Just a collection of a few custom functions I use often. 

As this package is for my own use, together with co-authors, there is zero guarantee of backwards compatibility: I may introduce changes that break previous code. You might want to specify a specific version when downloading, to ensure the code can be used over the long term: `remotes::install_github("MatthieuStigler/matPkg", ref="17f5cef53a28c2ca0a2ac8e1294f46904ab9e046")`

## Installation

You can install from

``` r
remotes::install_github("MatthieuStigler/matPkg", upgrade = "never")
```

If using `renv`:

``` r
renv::install("MatthieuStigler/matPkg")
```
